# Minimalistic Pentatronics 1000 app

This minimalistic application provides basic functionality though it does not provide logging or saving/loading of the state, nor animation. If an app is animating, this application will simulate running the app for 5 seconds and then will print the display.

From this directory, build with **make** and run with **./a.out**.

Note this application uses ncurses and has only been tested under MacOS.
