# Minimalistic Pentatronics 1000 emulator

This minimalistic Pentatronics 1000 emulator provides basic functionality though it does not provide logging or saving of the state. Because this emulator is single threaded, it will handle animations by running the Pentatronics 1000 for up to 5 seconds and then printing the display.

Under MacOS, from this directory, build with **make** and run with **./a.out**.

Note this application uses ncurses.
