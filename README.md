# Pentatronics 1000

Family of emulators for the classic Pentatronics 1000 calculator.

The engine itself is written in C (see **engine** folder) and can be used to write emulators for different platforms.

Currently, there are are 2 Command Line Interface emulators for MacOS:
- **mini** is a minimalistic bare bones emulator that provides basic functionality.
- **cli** is a more full featured emulator.

Under MacOS, build with **make** and run with **cli/a.out** or **mini/a.out**
