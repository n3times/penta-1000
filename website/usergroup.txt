Pentatronics Sunnyvale User Group

< insert 'under construction' image >

We are a small but growing group of enthusiasts of Pentatronics. Though less well known than TI and HP, Pentatronics produced, arguably, the very best calculators from 1977 (Pentatronics 1000) to 1982 (Pentatronics 3000).

We meet every second Tuesday of the month at "Lucky Joe" (next to Fry's Electronics).

Next meeting agenda:
* Edwin J. Gallaghan will be sharing his winning tips for HI-LO
* Robert Nelson Jr will demonstrate a rare prototype of the Pentatronics 3000
* We will discuss hosting the 1997 National Pentatronics convention

More details to come!
