# Minimalistic Pentatronics 1000 application. 
This application does not provide logging or saving/loading of the state. It does not support animation. If an app is animating, it will simulate running the app for 5 seconds and then print the current display.

From this directory, build with **make** and run with **./a.out**.

Note this has only been tested under MacOS. It may work for other Unix systems. Note that this application uses ncurses.
