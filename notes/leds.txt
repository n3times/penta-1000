Each LED is composed of 14 segments (leds 0 thru d) + 1 dot (led e)

There are 3 essential shapes:
- hexagons: 1 thru c
  - 1 3 5 8 a c: vertical  hexagons
  - 6 7: horizontal hexagons
  - 2 4 9 b: sheared hexagons
- long leds: 0 and d (can be hexagons or dented in the middle)
- dot: e (square or round)

To describe a display geometry, we just need:
  SEGMENT_WIDTH 
  VERTICAL_SEGMENT_LENGTH
  HORIZONTAL_SEGMENT_LENGTH
  SHEARED_SEGMENT_DX
  SHEARED_SEGMENT_DY
  DOT_DX
  DOT_RADIUS
  LED_ANGLE
  INTER_LED_DX

Also consider removing some thickness in each segment so that there is some separation between any 2 segments.
